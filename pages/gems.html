      <ul>
        <li>
          More often than not, we know what’s not in our best interest. But we
          choose to avoid those red flags. And go ahead with the wrong choice.
          We just need a little reminder.
        </li>
        <li>Do the hard thing. Rip the bandaid off.</li>
        <li>Take the stairs. Staying active is the smarter choice.</li>
        <li>
          Learning is not only about breadth, it’s about depth. Stop looking for
          shortcuts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stick to your values. It’ll make you feel better about yourself.

        from the practice, study it obsessively. Break it down and explore the
        nuances of the craft. Once it's time to perform, put all the thinking
        away and let the wisdom of intuition guide you. "
