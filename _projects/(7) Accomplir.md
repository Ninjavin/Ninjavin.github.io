description: I made this Chrome Extension taking an inspiration from Momentum, adding the features I needed and removing the overheads. It greets the user in a new tab with an aesthetic background, an inspirational quote, and provides direct access links to their social media profile. This reduces the clutter a new tab opens with and keeps the user away from any kind of distractions.
